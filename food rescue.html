            <h4><em>Clear View</em></h4><br>
            <p>Food waste occurs along the entire spectrum of production, from the farm to distribution to retailers to the consumer. Reasons include losses from mold, pests, or inadequate climate control; losses from cooking; and intentional food waste.</p><br>
            <p>This waste is categorized differently based on where it occurs:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Food “loss” occurs before the food reaches the consumer as a result of issues in the production, storage, processing, and distribution phases.</li><br>
                <li>Food “waste” refers to food that is fit for consumption but consciously discarded at the retail or consumption phases.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <div class="amount">
                <h3>Roughly a third of the world’s food is wasted. That’s about <u><em>1.3 billion tons</em></u> a year.</h3><br>
                <p>The world loses an astounding quantity of food every year. It blows your mind but a third of all food for human consumption in the world is lost or wasted. 1.3 billion tons of food suitable for human consumption and 1.6 billion tons of so-called "primary product equivalents” are lost or wasted.</p>

                <p>The UN Sustainable Development targets include the goals by 2030:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cutting in half global food waste at the retail and consumer levels per capita.</li><br>
                    <li>Reducing food loss in production and supply chains.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h4><i>but there’s a problem...</i></h4><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The retail and consumer levels account for just over a third of all food waste.</li><br>
                    <li>The world population will continue to grow and reach 8.6 billion in 2030. That’s around 800 million people more than in 2020.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p id="note"><b><u>Note:</u></b><i> This means that even if the target of cutting in half waste per capita (of a third of total food waste) total global food waste could still go up. And that’s a problem.</i></p>
